# File-Organiser
A python CLI tool to organise and clean folders automatically

 File Organizer

A Python CLI tool that scans a folder, organises files into subfolders by type, moves individual files, and deletes empty folders â€” all with a clean terminal interface.

---

 Features
- Scan any folder and display all files.
- Automatically organise files into subfolders:
  - Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives, Spreadsheets.
- Move a single file to any folder.
- Delete empty folders with animation.
- Optionally delete `.exe` setup files.
- Colour-coded terminal UI with smooth animations.

 What I Learned from creating this project:
- File and folder handling in Python (`os`, `shutil`).
- I learned how to fix recursive folder issues and how to handle empty folders without crashes.
- Error handling (`try/except`) and input validation.
- Building structured, modular CLI apps.
- Creating simple terminal animation and user feedback.
